# Low-Light Image Enhancement using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
Low-light images often suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, noise, and color distortion.  
This project implements a **deep learning–based image enhancement system** that improves image quality captured in low-light conditions while preserving natural colors and fine details.

The project includes a **trained CNN model** and an **interactive Streamlit web application** for easy image enhancement.
